Hi there! I'm Praneeth Kandula, currently working for Best Buy out of their corporate headquarters in Richfield, Minnesota as a Data Analyst in Fraud Risk - focused on architecting analytical/modeling solutions to combat e-commerce fraud, primarily leveraging Machine Learning and Statistics . I graduated with a Master's Degree in Business Analytics and Information Systems from the University of South Florida, Tampa in December 2018.

My past professional experience includes working with Bank of America as a Data Analyst intern crunching raw quantitative data to extract predictive signals and working as a Fraud Risk Analyst , leveraging transactional and historical data to fight e-commerce fraud at Amazon. I also have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from NIT Calicut, one of the premier Engineering Institutes in India. I love learning new things, solving puzzles, and making a positive impact on people around me.

I am currently exploring new opportunities and would love to talk. Give me a shout.
